# 

# A meal ordering system for employees working in industrial zones — a simple application for browsing daily menus, placing orders, and handling payments (BLIK / company invoice).

# 

# \## 🎯 Project Goal

# 

# This project addresses a real operational problem faced by catering companies serving factories and industrial zones, where:

# \- orders are placed by phone,

# \- daily orders are written down manually,

# \- billing and settlements are time-consuming and error-prone.

# 

# The goal of the application is to \*\*automate the ordering and payment process\*\* while keeping the user experience as simple and accessible as possible.

#
